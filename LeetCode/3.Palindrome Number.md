# Palindrome Number [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

## Example 1:

- Input: x = 121
- Output: true
- Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

## Example 2:

- Input: x = -121
- Output: false
- Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Example 3:

- Input: x = 10
- Output: false
- Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

## Solution:

```C++
  // C++ solution
  class Solution {
  public:
      bool isPalindrome(int x) {
          if(x<0) return false;
          long y = x;
          long s = 0;
          while(y>0){
              s = s*10 + y%10;
              y/=10;
          }
          if(s==x) return true;
          else return false;
      }
  };
```
